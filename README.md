# ImageResizer
This python program takes a .png file of an object and transforms it in to a 1:1 aspect ratio .png file without changing the form of the original image. This can be further developed to have the functionality to convert original png, transform it and save as jpg file. Also this can be modified to have the functionality to batch process images within a certain directory
